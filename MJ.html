            <h3 class="typing-text">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p>I'm a 19 year-old student that has a lot of curiosity and interest on things that are cool and captures my mind. Especially when we are talking about technology, PC parts and games, nature, cycling and Outer Space. 
                I enjoy connecting with people with the same interest and hobbies. 
                I usually go with the "It is what it is" quote so I don't stress myself too much and not enjoy my life because of it. It's like the <a href="https://i.imgflip.com/9au02y.jpg?a481328" target title="Chill guy meme from imgflip" style="color:#57a0ff">Chill guy meme</a> that spread a while ago</p>

                    <h4>Student</h4>
                    <p>I am student currently taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology where I learn how to understand and use Programming languages such as C++, Python, Java and many more. 
                        Though not gifted with a genius and brilliant mind, I still enjoy this course and learn many more along with my friends.

                    <h4>Gamer</h4>
                    <p>I'veplayed games since I was a child so I kind of grew with it. The first video game I played was a japanese game that is about action and roleplaying, you could call it a J-RPG game but sadly I forgot its title and plan on playing it again on my old PS2 console once I acquired its title.
                        For me, playing video games is more than a hobby that I do but rather a passion, a distraction from reality and de-stress or unwind from the problems I face.
                        I enjoy FPS games like Valorant and Left 4 Dead 2, action and strategy games like War Thunder and simulator games like American Truck Simulator, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and X-Plane.

                    <h4>Programmer</h4>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy programming as much as I hate it, because sometimes I don't understand how a single semi-colon made 256 errors in my code.
                        Kidding aside, I love learning programming and I always try to understand and implement them on things that I find interest with. 
                        I may or may not be a decent programmer but I still try to improve my skills on it and when I am stuck in a programming problem, my indian programming friends are always there to help me.</p>

                    <h4>Astronomer</h4>
                    <p> 
                        I love topics about the Outer Space like the Universes around the Milky Way Universe that our planet is in, the images from dust cloud like this <a href="https://assets.science.nasa.gov/dynamicimage/assets/science/astro/universe/internal_resources/670/Carina_Nebula_1098.jpeg?w=4096&format=jpeg&fit=clip&crop=faces%2Cfocalpoint" target title="dust cloud found in space" style="color:#57a0ff">dust cloud that was taken by James Webb Space Telescope</a>. 
                        I always watch a tv show in H2 channel called "The Universe" and there I saw and learned many cool and interesting facts about the Outer Space like the "Big Bang Theory", the theory that started everything, the "redshift" where an object is moving away from us and "blueshift" when it is moving towars us, the Black hole and White hole and many more.</p>
